# 🕹 Stickman-Game

A 2D physics-based built in Unity.  
The game features a floppy stickman character controlled entirely through Unity’s 2D joint system, inspired by titles like **Human: Fall Flat**, **Getting Over It**, and similar challenge-based movement games.

The result is intentionally awkward but fun character movement where mastering the controls becomes part of the game.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You control a stickman who can **barely walk**, and you must use physics to:

- Move through challenging environments  
- Manipulate objects  
- Go through HARD levels  
- Progress from level to level

## ✨ Features

- **Physics-driven movement**
  - No traditional animation system
  - Joints, forces, and real-time physics drive every motion

- **Puzzle-focused level design**
  - Think your way through each level
  - Use the environment to your advantage

- **Silly but rewarding controls**
  - Clumsy movement like "Human: Fall Flat"
  - Improving skill is part of the fun

- **Unity 2D**
  - Built entirely using C# and Unity's 2D physics tools
